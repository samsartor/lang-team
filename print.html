<p>Welcome to the repository for the Rust Language Design Team.  This
page stores our administrative information, meeting minutes, as well
as some amount of design constraints. It's also still a
work-in-progress (insert omnipresent mid 90s logo for under
construction here).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#chat-platform" id="chat-platform">Chat platform</a></h1>
<p>The lang team hangs out in the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/chat/zulip.html">rust-lang Zulip</a> in the <code>#t-lang</code>
stream. There are also other <code>#t-lang/*</code> streams that might be of
interest.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#calendar" id="calendar">Calendar</a></h1>
<p>We have a lang-team calendar that shows the time for our various meetings.
Meetings are generally open to anyone who wants to listen in. We also try to
post <a href="./minutes.html">minutes and recordings</a> on a &quot;best-effort&quot; basis from our
meetings.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#meetings" id="meetings">Meetings</a></h1>
<p>The lang team has two standing meetings. The current timing for these
can be found on the <a href="./calendar.html">lang team calendar</a>. We
generally record our public meetings and post the recordings in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85XCvVPmGQg-gYy7R6a_Y91oQLdsbSpa">YouTube playlist</a> (along with automatically created subtitles). We
also publish notes and minutes in written form in this github
repository.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#triage-meeting" id="triage-meeting">Triage meeting</a></h2>
<p>The weekly triage meeting is when we go over the newly filed project
proposals along with issues that have been nominated for lang-team
feedback. We also get regular updates from the active project groups
so we can stay on top of what is going on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes">Triage meeting minutes are available in this directory.</a></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nominating-an-issue-pr-rfc-etc-for-the-triage-meeting" id="nominating-an-issue-pr-rfc-etc-for-the-triage-meeting">Nominating an issue, PR, RFC etc for the triage meeting</a></h3>
<p>You can nominate an issue/PR/RFC etc for the triage meeting by adding
the <code>T-lang</code> and <code>I-nominated</code> labels. When you do so, it's best if
you leave a comment explaining what kind of feedback you would
like. We try to go over all nominated issues and leave a comment
of some kind in response.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#design-meeting" id="design-meeting">Design meeting</a></h2>
<p>The second weekly meeting is our <strong>design meeting</strong>. The design
meeting topics are used for in-depth discussions on a particular
topic, often in connection with an active working group.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#proposing-a-topic-for-a-design-meeting" id="proposing-a-topic-for-a-design-meeting">Proposing a topic for a design meeting</a></h3>
<p>You can propose a topic for a design meeting by opening an <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/new/choose">Design
meeting proposal</a> issue on the lang-team repository. During our weekly
traige meetings, we scan open issues to try and decide whether to
schedule meetings in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#priorities" id="priorities">Priorities</a></h1>
<p>This page describes the current lang team priorities and explains
their motivations. This page is typically updated as part of the
yearly Rust roadmap process. They are derived from a combination of
the Rust survey results, feedback from users, and other soruces. When
new project proposals are created, they can cite priorities listed in
this page.</p>
<p>Each priority also lists lang-team members who typically prefer to
liaison for issues in this area. This can give you an idea of who you
might reach out to if you wish to discuss a project proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2020-07-28</p>
<ul>
<li>Async I/O
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Continued improvements with ergonomics and productivity related to Async I/O.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Shows up heavily on the survey, this is an obvious area where a lot of Rust developers are working.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cramertj">cramertj</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C Parity, interop, and embedded -- these often overlap in 'low level capabilities'
<ul>
<li><strong>What</strong>? Extending Rust's low-level capabilities to do &quot;things otherwise only possible in C or assembly&quot;, as well as enabling smooth, ergonomic FFI between other languages and Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Embedded is a large factor in the survey.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Our ability to act like &quot;native C&quot; is a differentiating capability for Rust. We've seen a lot of traction integrating into big companies on this basis, as a C++ replacement. It's clear that doing this requires the ability to do piecewise adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett">joshtriplett</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Const generics and constant evaluation
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Supporting </li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Heavily requested feature and important for key areas.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trait and type system extensions
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Specifically impl Trait, GATs, and specialization</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Long-standing areas that affect a lot of domains, including async</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Error handling
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Combination of <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/#conclusion">library related improvements</a> that consolidate &quot;best practices&quot; into standard library, documentation to describe how it works, as well as possible language improvements to leverage those changes (try blocks, <code>yeet</code>/<code>throw</code> keyword, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Cross-cutting productivity concern, and a persistent problem that makes working with Rust code more difficult than it should be.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Anecdotally, something that comes up for a lot of people (see e.g. <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-in-2020-one-more-thing/">nrc's #rust2020 blog post</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett">joshtriplett</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Borrow checker expressiveness and other lifetime issues
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Think Polonius, RFC 2229, RFC 66, and other ideas like knowing which fields of <code>self</code> are used by particular methods.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Learning curve remains a stubborn problem, and the best way to improve it is to make the compiler smarter.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix">pnkfelix</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unsafe code capabilities and reference material
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Document the rules for legal unsafe code and add features that either add required capabilities or make correct code easier and more ergonomic to write.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Growing base of unsafe code, changes here are getting harder, this represents a kind of &quot;reputation risk&quot;. We really want to be &quot;better than C&quot; here.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix">pnkfelix</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Targeted ergonomic wins and extensions
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Small additions or improvements to make Rust easier to use.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> These will never rise to the &quot;top of the list&quot;, but they often have outsized impact on people's enjoyment of Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/scottmcm">scottmcm</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soundness holes to try and correct
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Rust's appeal rests on safety. We have to make steady progress on these points. It's often hard to prioritize them compared to &quot;whiz-bang&quot; features. Also, long-running safety issues can cause fallout when fixed, weakening our stability guarantees.</li>

<p>Would you like to find out what the lang team is working on? Check out
our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2">github project board</a>. It shows the active projects at each stage
of development, along with an explanation of the various stages. Each
project has a representative issue that links to more complete
information. The stages of a project are as follows: </p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Proposal</td><td>Deciding whether to start this project</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exploration</td><td>Exploring the problem space and deciding what RFC(s) to write</td></tr>
<tr><td>RFC</td><td>There is a pending RFC describing the design</td></tr>
<tr><td>Implementing</td><td>There is an accepted RFC, but implementation work is ongoing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>The RFC is fully implemented and we are requesting public feedback</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stabilized</td><td>The feature is complete and available on stable compilers</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If you'd like to read more about the stages of a project, or you would
like to propose a new project, see the <a href="./proposing_a_project.html">&quot;proposing a new
project&quot;</a> page.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#proposing-a-new-project" id="proposing-a-new-project">Proposing a new project</a></h1>
<p>Interested in extending the Rust language in some way? The language
design team is experimenting with a new staged process.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first-step-file-a-project-proposal" id="first-step-file-a-project-proposal">First step: file a Project Proposal</a></h2>
<p>The very first step is [file a <strong>project proposal</strong> issue]. A project
proposal is a lightweight issue that describes your motivations, any
ideas you've had thus far on the design, and other background
information.</p>
<p><strong>The primary role of the proposal is to request feedback on an idea
from the lang team.</strong> Before creating a proposal, it's a good idea to
create a thread on internals and float the idea to get immediate
feedback on whether the problem is real, prior ideas, or related
problems. However, you don't have to have a complete solution in mind
-- and it's fine to have 2 or 3 ideas for how one might solve
something.</p>
<p>Once you file the issue, a Zulip stream will be created and you may
start to get feedback right away. The proposal will also be discussed
in the <a href="./meetings.html#triage-meeting">triage meeting</a>, and we'll try to post general feedback from
that meeting.</p>
<p>The next step depends on the scope of the proposal and on whether a
[lang-team liaison] is available who has bandwidth.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#smaller-proposals-that-can-be-implemented-directly" id="smaller-proposals-that-can-be-implemented-directly">Smaller proposals that can be implemented directly</a></h3>
<p>If a proposal is considered &quot;small&quot;, then the lang-team will approve
the proposal to go straight to PR. In this case, the next step is
simply to create an implementation on the appropriate rust-lang
repository. The PR can cite the proposal page in its description.</p>
<p>Proposals approved to go straight to PR are tagged as
<code>implementation-needed</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#larger-proposals-that-require-an-rfc" id="larger-proposals-that-require-an-rfc">Larger proposals that require an RFC</a></h3>
<p>Most proposals however require some sort of RFC to be implemented. In
this case, we will create a <strong>project group</strong> to pursue the project.
A project group is just a group of people who are authoring the RFC
and pushing it through to stabilization (and ideally through
implementation as well, although sometimes that involves very
difficult people).</p>
<p>If we decide that a proposal requires an RFC, then once it is assigned
a liaison, it will be tagged with <code>charter-needed</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Propose a charter:</strong> The liaison will work with the author of the
proposal (and any other interested parties) to create a project
charter, based on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes">charter template</a>. This is often just a copy
of the MCP, updated with whatever new material came up during
discussion. The charter should be added to the lang-team repository
in a PR, and that PR can &quot;close&quot; the proposal issue.
<ul>
<li>This charter PR is approved by the lang-team with a <code>@rustbot fcp merge</code> command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exploration phase:</strong> Once the project is created, it enters the &quot;exploration
phase&quot;. We will create a Zulip stream, project issue, and potentially a repository
as desired. The goal of this phase is to explore the design space and to come up
with one or more RFCs that will actually solve the problem. The project
should keep the lang team up to date on the designs being considered during
this phase.
<ul>
<li>It is also permitted to land feature-gated code in the rust
compiler during this phase, although any such change should be
considered highly unstable (and should ideally be minimally
disruptive).</li>
<li>Project groups are also encouraged to write regular blog posts in the 
Inside Rust blog documenting their progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC phase:</strong> The output of the exploration phase is one or more
RFCs that describes the proposed design; these RFCs are typically
written by the project group collaboratively. It's a good idea to
create RFCs early because this they often receive much wider
community feedback and may uncover problems in the design.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation phase:</strong> Once the RFC is landed, implementation typically
begins, although it sometimes happens that implementation occurs concurrently
with authoring the RFC.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation phase:</strong> Once implementation of the RFC is complete, the project
group should write a blog post requesting evaluation. They should keep the
lang-team abreast of any feedback that is received.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization phase:</strong> Finally, the feature can be stabilized and released
on stable Rust. This is done by authorizing a stabilization report, as
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html">described here</a>.</li>

<h3><a class="header" href="#shortlisted-proposals" id="shortlisted-proposals">Shortlisted proposals</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, there is a liaison who really likes the idea of a
proposal, but does not presently have the bandwidth to pursue the
idea. In that case, it can be assigned to the liaison but tagged as
<code>shortlisted</code>. The liaison should comment on when they expect to have
bandwidth to help out; if other liaisons are available, they may want
to pick up the project instead.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-role-of-a-lang-team-liaison" id="what-is-the-role-of-a-lang-team-liaison">What is the role of a lang-team liaison?</a></h3>
<p>The lang-team liaison has the job of monitoring the progress on the
project and posting updates for the rest of the team. These updates
can be delivered in person at the <a href="./meetings.html#triage-meeting">triage meeting</a> or as comments on
the corresponding tracking issue for the project.</p>
<p>Liaisons should particularly focus on questions where the lang team
can help -- for example, if the project has narrowed down the set of
options to a few viable candidates, it would be good to seek lang team
feedback on which option seems the most promising (often this would be
a good point to request a <a href="./meetings.html#design-meeting">design meeting</a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes liaisons will also get actively involved in the design itself,
or help to mediate the exploration of the design space and ensure
that the project is pursuing all the possible designs.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-become-a-liaision" id="how-do-i-become-a-liaision">How do I become a liaision?</a></h3>
<p>Liaisons play an important role and hence must either members of the
lang-team or people that the lang team selects for the role. If you'd
be interested in serving as a liaison, feel free to ping the [lang
team leads] to express your interest!</p>
<p>If you're interested in eventually becoming a member of the lang team,
serving as a liaison is a necessary first step (but many people serve
as liaisons without the intention to join the lang team).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-things-the-lang-team-is-looking-for-in-a-proposal" id="what-are-the-things-the-lang-team-is-looking-for-in-a-proposal">What are the things the lang-team is looking for in a proposal?</a></h3>
<p>When evaluating project proposals, the lang-team is looking to figure
out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does this proposal solve a problem?</strong> Does that problem fit within our
stated priorities?</li>
<li><strong>Who are the people involved in this proposal?</strong> In particular, are
there stakeholders who have explored this design but are not
mentioned in the proposal?</li>
<li><strong>What is the scope of work involved and is it proportional to the
problem being solved?</strong> Sometimes there are problems that are really
complex to solve and ultimately not that important.</li>
<li><strong>How &quot;contained&quot; is this project?</strong> Sometimes, even narrow-sounding
features can wind up affecting lots of things in the language and
requiring lots of team bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>How controversial is this project and is it proportional to the
problem being solved?</strong> Let's be honest. Lang team discussions can
sometimes get quite heated. Sometimes we might decide that even if
we think an idea is good, it's not worth the controversy that will
result from pursuing it.</li>
<li><strong>Do we have the right people involved?</strong> Some ideas require
specific stakeholders to be a success. This might be because of
specific knowledge (e.g., deep understanding of the type system), or
because we want representatives for specific use cases, or because
we want representatives from a wider variety of
companies/backgrounds. If there have been big projects in this area,
we might want representatives from all those projects.</li>
<li><strong>What other things are going on?</strong> We are trying hard not to take
on more work than we can handle. It's very tempting in open source
to start a ton of different activities because there are often lots
of people around with good ideas, but having too many things going
on is very stressful for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section contains &quot;notes&quot; about the design of various proposals.
These are often just links to conversations, along with a few key
ideas and summaries. Sometimes it includes other information, such as
lang-team decisions about whether a particular proposal is viable.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#can-we-allow-integer-literals-like-1-to-be-inferred-to-floating-point-type" id="can-we-allow-integer-literals-like-1-to-be-inferred-to-floating-point-type">Can we allow integer literals like <code>1</code> to be inferred to floating point type?</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#background" id="background">Background</a></h2>
<p>In rust today, an integer like <code>1</code> cannot be inferred to floating
point type. This means that valid-looking numeric expressions like
<code>22.5 + 1</code> will not compile, and one must instead write <code>22.5 + 1.0</code>. Can/should we change this?</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#history" id="history">History</a></h2>
<p>This was discussed on Zulip in <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html">May 2020</a>. Some of the key highlights from the discussion were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating point literals are prone to many surprises that integers
are not. For <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196887384">example</a>, <code>20_000_000 + 1</code>, if inferred to <code>f32</code>
type, would have the final value <code>20_000_000.0</code>. This leads some to
conclude that <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196887384">&quot;the surprise factor of floats is so high that they
are qualitatively different than integers&quot;</a>.</li>
<li>But there are a lot of similar surprising things:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196930252"><code>20_000_001_f32</code>, for example, is also going to be <code>20_000_000</code>.</a></li>
<li>Integer overflow can mean that <code>255 + 1</code> has the value 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some key questions to consider:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196926142">How often does adding <code>.0</code> result in some insight?</a></li>
<li>How much would <em>seeing</em> the <code>.0</code> help to debug a tricky problem?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balanced against the annoyance and surprise factor.</li>
</ul>
